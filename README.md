## Completed
- Implemented the database schema and relationships for Users and Timeslots.
- Created an API endpoint for creating timeslots (batch and single).
- Frontend: Added context switching for testing purposes and began mapping component tree

## Incomplete
- Frontend functionality
- Backend calls

Next Steps
- more familiar with frontend so I wanted to save it for last, unfortunately I spent too much time on backend and database

For timeslot creation handling, I wanted to have it be fully frontend when creating timeslots on a new day. And if the coach navigates to a different day it will return all timeslots on that date, and based on each timeslot object's status it would disable the time checkbox or enable it.
